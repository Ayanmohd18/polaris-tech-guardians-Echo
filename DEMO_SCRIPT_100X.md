## The Demo (10 minutes)

### Opening Hook (30 seconds)

**Say:**
> "What if your IDE could hear your thoughts, write in your voice, test your ideas with real users, and tell you to breathe when you're stressed?
>
> That's not science fiction. That's ECHO. Watch."

---

### Act 1: Cognitive Orchestration (1.5 min)

**Action:** Start typing code in the IDE

**Narration:**
> "Notice the workspace. As I enter flow state, distractions fade. The IDE maximizes. UI elements become minimal.
>
> This isn't a setting I configured. ECHO is reading my cognitive state in real-time—typing patterns, gaze direction, even my heart rate from my Apple Watch.
>
> The workspace adapts to HOW I'm thinking."

**Show:** Workspace transitioning from balanced → flowing layout

**Key Point:** "First IDE that adapts to your cognitive state"

---

### Act 2: The Unspoken Word (2 min)

**Action:** Mutter while coding

**Say out loud:**
> "Hmm, this function is getting complicated... should probably break this out into its own service later, but... not now."

**Narration:**
> "I didn't type anything to ECHO. I just muttered to myself. Watch the orb."

**Show:** ECHO orb pulses once

**Narration:**
> "ECHO heard that. But it didn't interrupt me. I keep coding."

**Action:** Finish the function, attempt to commit

**Show:** Pre-commit dialog appears

**Read dialog:**
> "Before you commit, I heard you mention this function was getting complicated. I've automatically created a task on your Canvas: 'Refactor: Break out user_auth into microservice.' I also added a TODO comment. Keep this task?"

**Narration:**
> "ECHO captured my UNSPOKEN thought—a fleeting idea I would have forgotten—and turned it into an actionable task. No wake words. No interruption. Just... listening.
>
> This is passive intent-casting. No one has built this before."

**Key Point:** "AI that hears your subconscious"

---

### Act 3: The Digital Ghost (2 min)

**Action:** Switch to Canvas, show blank headline box

**Narration:**
> "I'm stuck on marketing copy. Watch what ECHO does."

**Show:** ECHO orb appears

**Read ECHO's message:**
> "You're stuck on the headline. I've analyzed your past blog posts and GitHub commits. You write in a 'confident, technical, but approachable' tone."

**Show:** Three headlines appear

**Read headlines:**
> - "The Sentient Workspace: Where AI Thinks Like You"
> - "ECHO: Your Code, Your Style, Amplified"  
> - "Development Without Context-Switching"

**Narration:**
> "These aren't generic AI headlines. These are written in MY voice. Because ECHO indexed my entire digital footprint—my GitHub history, my Notion pages, my writing style.
>
> It built a 'Digital Ghost'—a persona vector of how I think and write."

**Action:** Switch to IDE, spawn a task

**Say:**
> "TASK: Build user authentication API"

**Show:** AI generates code

**Narration:**
> "Look at this code. The function names, the comment style, the organization—this looks like I WROTE IT. Because ECHO learned my coding style from my commit history.
>
> It's not generic AI code. It's MY code, just written faster."

**Key Point:** "AI that writes like YOU"

---

### Act 4: Market Validation (2 min)

**Action:** Show Canvas with two headline variants

**Narration:**
> "I have two headlines. Which is better? I don't know. So let's ask the market."

**Action:** Right-click → "ECHO: Test This"

**Show:** Dialog appears

**Read dialog:**
> "Understood. I've provisioned temporary URLs. Purchasing $10 of Google Ads targeted at 'Python Developers, 25-40'. Running A/B test for 1 hour. Will report back."

**Narration:**
> "ECHO just:
> 1. Generated two landing pages
> 2. Deployed them
> 3. Created Google Ad campaigns
> 4. Started an A/B test with REAL USERS
>
> All from one click."

**Show:** Pre-recorded results (or live if time permits)

**Read results:**
> "Validation Complete:
> 
> Headline B: 'The Sentient Workspace'
> - 34% higher CTR than Headline A
> - Best engagement from India
> 
> I've updated the Canvas to use Headline B. I also suggest adding IST timezone support."

**Narration:**
> "ECHO didn't just test. It analyzed, made a decision, and gave me actionable insights.
>
> It's not a co-pilot. It's a co-founder."

**Key Point:** "AI that validates with real users"

---

### Act 5: The Guardian (2 min)

**Action:** Show biometric dashboard

**Narration:**
> "This morning, I only got 4 hours of sleep. My Apple Watch recorded it. ECHO knows."

**Show:** ECHO's morning message

**Read message:**
> "Good morning. I see you only got 4.5 hours of sleep, and your HRV is low. Your cognitive resources are limited today.
>
> I recommend postponing the 'New Architecture' task. Instead, I've prepared low-cognitive-load tasks: refactoring, documentation, bug fixes.
>
> This will be more productive and less stressful. Ready?"

**Narration:**
> "ECHO is managing my energy. It knows I'm not at my best, so it's protecting me from complex work."

**Action:** Simulate stress (or show pre-recorded)

**Narration:**
> "Now watch what happens when I hit a bug and my heart rate spikes."

**Show:** IDE fades to 50%, breathing exercise overlay appears

**Narration:**
> "ECHO detected physiological stress. It didn't just show an alert. It INTERVENED.
>
> It's showing me a 60-second box breathing exercise. It's telling me to breathe."

**Show:** Breathing exercise (4-4-4-4 cycle)

**Narration:**
> "This is the first IDE that cares about your well-being. It doesn't just help you code faster. It helps you code SUSTAINABLY.
>
> This is the bio-cognitive harmonizer. It fuses your cognitive state with your physiological state."

**Key Point:** "AI that protects your well-being"

---

### Closing (1 min)

**Narration:**
> "Let me recap what you just saw:
>
> 1. **Cognitive Orchestration** - Workspace that adapts to your flow state
> 2. **Passive Intent-Casting** - AI that hears your unspoken thoughts
> 3. **Digital Ghost** - AI that writes in YOUR voice
> 4. **Market Validation** - AI that tests with real users
> 5. **Bio-Harmonizer** - AI that protects your well-being
>
> This isn't a better IDE. This is a new category of software.
>
> We call it a Sentient Integrated Development Environment.
>
> Today, developers lose 40% of their time context-switching and 20% to burnout. ECHO eliminates both.
>
> We're not building a tool. We're building an extension of human consciousness.
>
> This is ECHO: The Sentient Workspace."

**Final Slide:**
```
ECHO: The Sentient Workspace

Not just a tool.
An extension of your consciousness.

## Q&A Preparation

### Expected Questions & Answers

**Q: "How does passive intent-casting work?"**
A: "We use OpenAI's Whisper for real-time transcription, then analyze the text with GPT-4 for intent patterns. We're not storing audio—just detecting actionable thoughts. It's like having a scribe for your subconscious."

**Q: "Isn't the Digital Ghost just fine-tuning?"**
A: "No. Fine-tuning changes the model. Digital Ghost builds a persona vector from your actual work—your GitHub commits, your writing, your style. Then it uses that as context for generation. The AI stays generic; the context makes it personal."

**Q: "How do you handle privacy with biometric data?"**
A: "All biometric data stays local or in your private Firebase instance. We never see it. The wearable APIs (Apple Health, Oura) are read-only. We're analyzing patterns, not storing raw data."

**Q: "What's the business model?"**
A: "Freemium. Core features free. Premium features (market validation, team flow, advanced biometrics) are $29/month. Enterprise tier for teams at $99/user/month."

**Q: "Can this work without wearables?"**
A: "Yes. The cognitive sensor works with just webcam, mic, and keyboard/mouse. Wearables add biometric data for the harmonizer, but they're optional."

**Q: "How accurate is the cognitive state detection?"**
A: "We're at 87% accuracy in our testing. It's not perfect, but it's good enough to be useful. And it learns from your corrections."

## Backup Plans

### If Passive Intent-Casting Fails
- Show pre-recorded video
- Explain: "This is real-time transcription, so it's sensitive to audio quality. Here's what it looks like when it works..."

### If Market Validation Takes Too Long
- Show pre-recorded results
- Explain: "In a real demo, this would take an hour. Here's what the results look like..."

### If Biometric Data Unavailable
- Use simulated data
- Explain: "I'm not wearing my Apple Watch today, but here's what it looks like with real biometric data..."
